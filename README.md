# 🧠 Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Engineering Portfolio!  
This repository includes projects I’ve built while learning and practicing data engineering concepts, focusing on **ETL pipelines**, **data modeling**, and **workflow orchestration** using **Python, NumPy, Airflow, and PostgreSQL**.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. 🗃️ ERD Project (Entity Relationship Diagram)
**Goal:** Design a normalized relational database schema and visualize entity relationships.  
**Highlights:**
- Built an **ERD** for a sample business dataset (e.g., sales, customers, orders).
- Defined **primary and foreign keys** to ensure referential integrity.
- Created database tables in **PostgreSQL** using SQL scripts.
- Demonstrated **data modeling best practices** (normalization, relationships).

### 2. ⚙️ ETL Pipeline with Airflow
**Goal:** Automate data extraction, transformation, and loading into PostgreSQL.  
**Highlights:**
- Designed a **DAG** in **Apache Airflow** to manage data flow.
- Used **Python scripts** and **NumPy** for transformations and numerical computations.
- Loaded processed data into **PostgreSQL**.
- Scheduled tasks with Airflow to simulate production pipelines.

## 🧩 Future Enhancements

- Get familiar with **cloud tools** and services used in modern data pipelines (AWS, GCP, Azure).  
- Learn and apply **Cloud Data Engineering** principles (data lakes, warehouses, and orchestration).  
- Understand and implement **Modern Data concepts** such as ELT, DataOps, and modular pipeline design.  
- Build **end-to-end Python pipelines** for data extraction, transformation, and loading across multiple environments.  
- Expand projects to include **data warehouse modeling** (Star and Snowflake schemas).  
- Integrate **cloud storage** and **data ingestion tools** like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.  
- Develop **visual dashboards** on top of the data for real-time analytics.
