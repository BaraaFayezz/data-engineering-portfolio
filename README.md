# 🧠 Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Engineering Portfolio!  
This repository includes projects I’ve built while learning and practicing data engineering concepts, focusing on **data cleaning**, **ETL pipelines**, **data modeling**, and **workflow orchestration** using **Python, NumPy, Pandas, Airflow, and PostgreSQL**.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. 🗃️ ERD Project (Entity Relationship Diagram)
**Goal:** Design a normalized relational database schema and visualize entity relationships.  
**Highlights:**
- Built an **ERD** for a sample business dataset (e.g., sales, customers, orders).
- Defined **primary and foreign keys** to ensure referential integrity.
- Created database tables in **PostgreSQL** using SQL scripts.
- Demonstrated **data modeling best practices** (normalization, relationships).

### 2. 🐍 Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering with Python
**Goal:** Read, clean, and transform raw CSV data into a structured dataset for analysis and reporting.  
**Highlights:**
- Loaded raw data from **CSV files** using **Pandas**.  
- Cleaned and standardized data (handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers).  
- Performed **feature engineering** to create new insights and analytical fields.  
- Applied **NumPy** for numerical operations and data transformations.  
- Exported the final cleaned dataset into a new CSV file.  
- Generated **basic reports** and summary statistics from the transformed data.

### 3. 🏬 Capstone Project: End-to-End Retail Data Pipeline with Python, SQL & Airflow
**Goal:** Build a complete data pipeline for a retail business, from raw data ingestion to loading into a PostgreSQL database for analytics and visualization.  
**Highlights:**
- Developed an **end-to-end ETL pipeline** using **Python** and **Apache Airflow**.  
- Extracted raw transactional data from multiple sources (CSV, API, etc.).  
- Transformed data using **NumPy** and **Pandas** for cleaning and aggregations.  
- Loaded the processed data into **PostgreSQL** for analysis and reporting.  
- Designed **DAGs** in Airflow to automate and schedule data workflows.  
- Implemented **data quality checks** and logging for pipeline reliability.  
- Created **data visualizations with Matplotlib** to explore trends in sales and performance metrics.
