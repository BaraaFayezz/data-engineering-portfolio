# 🛒 Capstone Project: End-to-End Retail Data Pipeline with Airflow, Python, and PostgreSQL

## 📘 Overview
This project builds a complete **data pipeline** using **Apache Airflow**, **PostgreSQL**, **Python**, and **Matplotlib** to automate the process of extracting order data, calculating daily revenue, and visualizing sales trends.

The pipeline is orchestrated in Airflow with three key stages:
1. **Fetch Order Data** → Extract data from PostgreSQL and store it as a CSV file.
2. **Process Daily Revenue** → Calculate daily total revenue using Pandas.
3. **Plot Daily Revenue** → Generate a visual trend chart of daily sales revenue.

## 🧠 Key Objectives
- Demonstrate data engineering skills using Airflow for scheduling and orchestration.  
- Practice ETL concepts (Extract, Transform, Load).  
- Build automated workflows for analytics.  
- Generate insights from retail sales data.
